## Final Conclusion:
The Booking & Revenue Analytics Dashboard reveals a total of 1,000 bookings, generating $139.5K in revenue with an average booking price of $0.139K. Afternoon slots contribute the highest revenue at $81.77K (58.6%), while night and evening slots generate significantly lower revenue at $12.67K (9.1%) and $9.83K (7%), respectively. The confirmed vs. pending ratio fluctuates around 50%, indicating room for improvement in booking confirmation processes. Facility utilization is highest for classes (0.27K bookings) and lowest for birthday parties (0.20K bookings). Price sensitivity analysis shows 58.8% of revenue ($81.96K) comes from high-priced bookings, indicating strong customer preference for premium services. Weekday-wise, Tuesday has the lowest confirmed bookings (56), presenting an opportunity for targeted promotions. To optimize revenue, strategies should focus on improving confirmation rates, maximizing high-demand time slots, and boosting engagement on underperforming weekdays.
